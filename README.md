# React Portfolio Assignment

The goal of this assignment was to create a portfolio using React.

First, I created a rough skeleton of the pages and components using html, then reworked them using React JSX syntax. 

Then, I worked on the necessary funtionality for message input forms conditional rendering of each section of the portfolio.

Next, I added styling to the page by passing CSS variables into the page and component renders as props.

Next, I installed the necessary packages needed to build and run the app, and deployed the app using Github pages.

A link to the deployed app can be found here: https://brianmckennaman.github.io/brian-mckenna-react-portfolio/

A screenshot of the functional app is provided here:
